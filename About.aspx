                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>The nonprofit Alliance for Girls in STEM was founded in 2013 by Sean Reed (<a target="_blank" title="Sean Reed on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/kittykaraoke">Twitter</a>, <a target="_blank" title="Sean Reed on LinkedIn" href="http://linkedin.com/in/seanreed1">LinkedIn</a>) to take a unique approach to encouraging more girls to consider science and technology fields as goals and options.
</p><p>We are a publisher that will give our readers something that is far too uncommon: young girls who are keenly interested in science and technology and who are the MAIN characters in their own stories. </p>
<p>We believe the media we create will have the power to help more girls identify science as something that is not reserved for boys alone.</p>
<p>Our mission: To show both girls and boys that girls belong in science and technology, too!</p>
<p>If we (and others) produce more books with young girls interested in science, technology, engineering, and math as the MAIN characters in their own stories, we believe we can build a large cohort of girls who will not have any problem self-identifying as someone who likes science and math, inspire the next generation of tech workers and leaders, and ultimately increase the number of women in the STEM-related careers where they are currently underrepresented.</p>
